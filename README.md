# OilyGiant Mining Company Data Science Repository

## Overview
In today's dynamic and competitive oil industry, the strategic location and development of new oil wells are crucial for companies like OilyGiant Mining Company to maximize profitability and ensure sustainable operations. This repository presents a data science project focused on leveraging predictive modeling techniques to analyze oil well characteristics and estimate reserve volumes within different geographic regions. The goal is to identify promising locations for drilling new wells based on comprehensive data analysis and machine learning.

## Description
The project utilizes oil sample data from three distinct regions, along with known well parameters, to develop a robust predictive model. By applying advanced machine learning algorithms, the aim is to accurately estimate reserve volumes for potential new oil wells. The analysis will also assess the economic viability and associated risks of drilling in each region using innovative methodologies such as Bootstrapping.

## Objectives
- Develop predictive models to estimate oil reserve volumes in three distinct regions.
- Identify the region with the highest potential profitability for drilling new oil wells.
- Evaluate and compare risks associated with drilling in each region using statistical techniques like Bootstrapping.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations to guide decision-making in selecting optimal drilling sites.
